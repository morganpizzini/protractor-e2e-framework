Navigation flow should be
            -> pippo
. dummy               -> mickey  -> minnie
            -> pluto

Mickey should implement two kind of navigation flow.. 
could insert generic key value array where by navigationFlow i can set parent flow.
- logBook logic -> Set default flow in array, resolve flow in navigationFlow class and navigate

```
{
    pippo: dummy,
    mickey:pippo,
    minnie:mickey
}

dummy -> pippo -> mickey -> minnie

navBook[mickey] = pluto

dummy -> pluto -> mickey -> minnie
```

// ------------------------------ \\

i should be able to move to minnie by different actions on Pippo, 
like click on 2 different buttons inside Pippo which send me to Mickey and then to Minnie
handled by specific navflowenum and then reflect on some framework config for know which is the default action on navigation
